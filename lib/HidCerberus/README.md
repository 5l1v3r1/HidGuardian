# The hound of Hades
> For Hell and the foul fiend that rules<br/>
God's everlasting fiery jails<br/>
(Devised by rogues, dreaded by fools),<br/>
With his grim, grisly dog that keeps the door,<br/>
Are senseless stories, idle tales,<br/>
Dreams, whimseys, and no more. 

\- John Wilmot, The Complete Poems

# About
HidCerberus (previously known as Zerberus or simply Cerberus) is the puppeteer behind its fellow kernel-mode companion `HidGuardian`. Together they have the power to dictate, which application may get the merciful access to an input device and which will be left enchained, begging for their release.

HidCerberus can be run as either a stand-alone console application or a Windows Service (recommended) with elevated privileges to even guard administrative processes. It's a single self-contained executable with only a small set of 3rd party dependencies based on which features it shall provide.

HidCerberus by itself doesn't decide which process gets access to a certain device; it offloads this decision-making process to plug-ins called Vigils.

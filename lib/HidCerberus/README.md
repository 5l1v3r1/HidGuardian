# The hound of Hades
> For Hell and the foul fiend that rules<br/>
God's everlasting fiery jails<br/>
(Devised by rogues, dreaded by fools),<br/>
With his grim, grisly dog that keeps the door,<br/>
Are senseless stories, idle tales,<br/>
Dreams, whimseys, and no more. 

\- John Wilmot, The Complete Poems

# About
HidCerberus (previously known as Zerberus or simply Cerberus) is the puppeteer behind its fellow kernel-mode companion `HidGuardian`. Together they have the power to dictate, which application may get the merciful access to an input device and which will be left enchained, begging for their release.

HidCerberus consists of a single self-contained library (DLL) with 3rd party dependencies already baked into it.

HidCerberus by itself doesn't decide which process gets access to a certain device; it offloads this decision-making process to a host called a Vigil.
